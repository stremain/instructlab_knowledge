==Early life and education==
Born in the village of Shaykh Daud, located near the city of [[Cusae|al-Qusiyya]] in [[Asyut Governorate]], Abu Zayd grew up in a [[Egyptian nationalism|nationalist]] household. Her father's job at the [[Egyptian National Railways|Egyptian State Railways]] meant that he was assigned to many stations and was constantly on the move. Although her mother was illiterate, Abu Zayd was encouraged to read and was given access to her father's large library.<ref name="Goldschmidt"/>
Abu Zayd received an advanced education. After completing her [[secondary education]] at the Helwan Girls School, she obtained a [[Licentiate (degree)|licence]] in history from [[Cairo University]] (then named Fuad I University) in 1940. She progressed further in her academic studies by receiving a teaching certificate in 1941, a [[Master of Arts]] in education in 1950 from the [[University of St Andrews]], and finally a [[doctorate]] in [[educational psychology]] from the [[University of London]] in 1957. She taught in the Women's College of [[Ain Shams University]] from 1955 to 1964, before being promoted to the rank of [[Professor#Egypt|professor]] at Cairo University in 1965.<ref name="Goldschmidt"/>

==Tenure as minister==
In 1962, Abu Zayd sat on the preparatory committee for the [[National Congress of Popular Forces]]. During her membership of the committee, she expressed her disagreement with [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] over some sections in the [[Charter of National Action]]. Impressed, Nasser decided to appoint her as a minister.<ref name="Turki">{{Cite journal|last=Turki|first=Sayyed|date=8 December 2010|title=الوزيرة حكمت قلب الثورة الرحيم|trans-title=Minister Hikmat, the Merciful Heart of the Revolution|journal=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|issue=2369|language=Arabic|accessdate=27 February 2011|url=http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=280253|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707115053/http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=280253|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref> On 29 September 1962, Abu Zayd was named minister of social affairs in [[Ali Sabri]]'s first government.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://modernegypt.bibalex.org/TxtViewer/TextViewer.aspx?ID=23739&type=Document |title=Presidential Decree Appointing Hikmat Abu Zayd as Minister of Social Affairs in Ali Sabri's First Government|date=29 September 1962 |work=Memory of Modern Egypt Digital Archive|publisher=[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]|language=Arabic|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> She retained her role when the cabinet was reshuffled in March 1964,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://modernegypt.bibalex.org/TxtViewer/TextViewer.aspx?ID=23740&type=Document|title=Presidential Decree Appointing Hikmat Abu Zayd as Minister of Social Affairs in Ali Sabri's Second Government |date=25 March 1964|work=Memory of Modern Egypt Digital Archive |publisher=[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]|language=Arabic|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> and served until 1965.<ref>[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&pg=PA173 p. 173]</ref>

Abu Zayd was part of a new female leadership that shared the same [[lower middle class]] background of Nasser and his fellow [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]].<ref name="Talhami">[[#Tal96|Talhami 1996]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1vjXmi5emY4C&pg=PA19 pp. 19–20]</ref> Her appointment by Nasser was made in the context of his new socialist program, which put emphasis on broadening access to education and employment for all people, regardless of gender or social class.<ref name="Badran">[[#Bad96|Badran 1996]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vrw8WGOmscAC&pg=PA188 p. 188]</ref> The 1950s and especially the 1960s were a time of increased female emancipation in Egypt.<ref>[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&pg=PA80 p. 80]</ref> [[Polygyny]] was on the decline, and women were increasingly holding key posts in government, industry and academia.<ref name="Gazette 1963">{{Cite news |title=Egypt's Women Most Emancipated in Region |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DJMtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CZ4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=7248,4152464|agency=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|date=21 October 1963|page=10|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> The country's first two female parliamentarians, [[Rawya Ateya]] and [[Amina Shukri]], were elected in 1957.<ref>[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&pg=PA39 p. 39]</ref> [[Karimah al-Sa'id]] became the deputy minister of education in the 1960s. Such high-level appointments of a few well-qualified women were showcased by the government, while the majority of Egyptian women remained stuck in the lower echelons of society.<ref name="Badran"/>
Nasser's appointment of Abu Zayd was a politically significant move. Including a woman in the cabinet was a way for him to co-opt female-run charitable organizations into the [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]] (ASU), the country's newly formed [[One-party state|sole political party]].<ref>[[#Rus04|Russell 2004]], [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofmo00phil_2 <!-- quote=co-opt. --> p. 39]</ref> Many of these associations were headed by women from prominent families and were protective of their independence, which Nasser found objectionable. His regime targeted women's organizations in the early 1960s and moved to take over most of their functions as state responsibilities, thereby depriving the associations of their momentum and autonomy. Abu Zayd implemented these policies, which were aimed at benefiting female workers and peasants.<ref>[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&pg=PA81 p. 81]</ref> The Ministry of Social Affairs which she headed was increasingly specializing in women's issues.<ref name="Talhami"/> In 1963, it organized a general and wide-ranging women's conference to discuss, among other things, ways to increase female economic [[productivity]], working women's leading role in spreading [[family planning]], as well as the rise of family income through the employment of female members. Abu Zayd was named to preside over the conference, thereby cementing her status as leader of the [[Feminism in Egypt|women's movement in Egypt]].<ref name="Talhami"/> She became coordinator for women's activities within the Arab Socialist Union in 1963,<ref name="Goldschmidt"/> at a time when the party had nearly 250,000 female members.<ref name="Gazette 1963"/>

During her time in office, Abu Zayd worked on several different social issues. She strongly supported a law that prohibited [[Divorce (Islamic)|Islamic oral repudiation]] and made it mandatory for a husband to go to court to be able to divorce his wife.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Egypt's Divorce Law May Be Changed|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KGQhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5YYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3989,4125145|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Tri-City Herald]]|date=29 January 1964|page=20|accessdate=27 February 2011}}{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In order to combat [[Begging|mendicity]], she imposed prison terms on recidivist beggars who returned to begging after they had received state-sponsored training in handicrafts.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Prison Eyed for Beggars |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ltxXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5OgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3156,3756081 |agency=[[Reuters]] |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=29 November 1964|page=16 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> In addition to registering [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and expanding their development activities, she launched projects aimed at improving the status of rural women.<ref name="Noureddine"/> One of the most sensitive tasks assigned to Abu Zayd was the relocation of thousands of [[Nubian people|Nubians]], displaced by the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], to newly built villages. Her management of the resettlement process led to her being [[nickname]]d the "Merciful Heart of the Revolution" by Nasser.<ref name="Turki"/> Nevertheless, the Nubians' [[Development-induced displacement|forced displacement]] remains controversial in Egypt to this day, with some blaming Nasser for the neglectful conditions in which the relocated Nubians have been living since then.<ref name="Noureddine"/>

On a personal level, Abu Zayd faced domestic problems during her tenure as minister. Her husband was resentful of her responsibility-laden role and of the amount of time she spent outside the house. Their previously modest lifestyle changed considerably as she hired a 12-year-old [[houseboy]] and was provided a [[Take-home vehicle|chauffeur-driven car]] by the government.<ref name="Gazette 1962">{{Cite news |title=Wife's Job Has Spouse Resentful|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMAtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Cp4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6000,3285101 |agency=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|date=16 November 1962|page=9|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>

==Exile in Libya==
Following Nasser's death in 1970 and [[Anwar Sadat]]'s ascension to the presidency, Abu Zayd's career progression was blocked. She moved to [[Libya]] with her husband in 1974.<ref name="Goldschmidt"/> Her Nasserist convictions were in line with the [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]], [[anti-Zionism]] and [[pan-Arabism]] of Libya's leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].<ref name="Turki"/> Abu Zayd spent nearly two decades in Libya, during which time she taught [[political science]] at [[Al Fateh University]] in [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]].<ref name="Noureddine"/> She also penned articles and made speeches denouncing the Egyptian government.<ref name="Goldschmidt"/>

Abu Zayd began criticizing President Sadat in the mid-1970s. She became a leader of the [[Egyptian National Front]], which was set up in [[Damascus]] in 1980 by General [[Saad El Shazly]]. The organization called for the overthrow of Sadat's government.<ref>[[#Sul86|Sullivan 1986]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&pg=PA120 p. 120]</ref> Due to her opposition to Sadat's peace overture to [[Israel]], Abu Zayd was accused of [[high treason]], [[terrorism]] and [[spying]], and was consequently deprived of her Egyptian nationality.<ref name="Turki"/> This turned her into a [[Statelessness|stateless]] political [[refugee]].<ref name="Noureddine"/> A long legal battle ensued, which was finally resolved in late 1991 when a judge ruled that Abu Zayd and her husband were entitled to their [[Egyptian passport]]s.<ref name="Goldschmidt"/> She was also acquitted of the charges of high treason and terrorism.<ref name="Turki"/><ref name="Noureddine"/>

==Later years and death==
After having recovered their nationality, Abu Zayd and her husband came back to Egypt in March 1992.<ref name="Goldschmidt"/> She was treated as a [[Very Important Person|VIP]] upon her return, and rushed to visit Nasser's [[mausoleum]].<ref name="Turki"/> During the 1990s, she opposed the [[Gulf War]], the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Peace Conference]], as well as Zionism and [[American imperialism]]. She wrote articles for ''[[al-Osboa]]'' newspaper in 1998 dealing with the issues of Western imperialism and Arab unity.<ref name="Goldschmidt"/> In late 2010, she was hospitalized at the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo to receive treatment for her [[bone fracture]]s.<ref name="Noureddine">{{Cite journal|last=Noureddine|first=Sarah|date=8 December 2010|title=المصري اليوم حاورتها على فراش المرض حكمت أبوزيد أول وزيرة مصرية: معظم الحركات السياسية الموجودة الآن سطحية.. وتعارض باندفاع غير مسؤول|trans-title=Almasry Alyoum interviewed her on her sickbed – Hikmat Abu Zayd, the first Egyptian female minister: Most current political movements are "superficial" and oppose with an "irresponsible" impulsiveness|journal=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|issue=2369|language=Arabic|accessdate=27 February 2011|url=http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=280252|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707115102/http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=280252|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref> [[Farkhonda Hassan]] visited her there on behalf of then First Lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=6 December 2010|title=قومي المرأة يطمئن على صحة د. حكمت أبوزيد|trans-title=National Council for Women reassured about Dr. Hikmat Abu Zayd's health condition|journal=[[Al Gomhuria]]|language=Arabic|accessdate=27 February 2011|url=http://www.gom.com.eg/index.php?action=news&id=76169|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720131213/http://www.gom.com.eg/index.php?action=news&id=76169|archivedate=20 July 2011}}</ref> During her stay at the hospital, Abu Zayd granted an interview to ''[[Almasry Alyoum]]'' newspaper in which she defended Nasser's legacy and lamented the loss of tolerance in Egypt.<ref name="Noureddine"/>

Abu Zayd died in Cairo on 30 July 2011.<ref name=ahr11/>
